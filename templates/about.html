            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                The African Table was created to showcase the diversity of African food.
                Each dish has a story, each country has its own unique flavour,
                and each recipe reflects the spirit of its people.
                Through this project, we hope to inspire curiosity, appreciation,
                and connection to the continent’s rich culinary heritage.
